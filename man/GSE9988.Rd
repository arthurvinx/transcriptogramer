\description{
Expression values, obtained by microarray, of 3 cases and 3 controls
referring to the Gene Expression Omnibus accession number GSE9988.
The data.frame has 6 columns, each one contains expression values of a
sample, the first 3 columns are case samples, and the last 3 are control
samples. Each row contains expression values obtained by the probe mentioned
in its respective rowname. The expression values were normalized using the
\pkg{affy} package and, to reduce the required storage space,
this data.frame contains only 6 samples (GSM252443, GSM252444,
GSM252445, GSM252465, GSM252466, GSM252467). The rows of each sample
are composed only by probes mapped, by the GPL570 dictionary,
to proteins, from STRINGdb release 10.5,
of combined score greater than or equal to 900.
